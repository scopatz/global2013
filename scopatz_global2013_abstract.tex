%    Notes: 
%      (1) You can use the "dvips" utility to convert .dvi 
%          files to PostScript.  Then, use either Acrobat 
%          Distiller or "ps2pdf" to convert to PDF format. 
%      (2) Different versions of LaTeX have been observed to 
%          shift the page down, causing improper margins.
%          If this occurs, adjust the "topmargin" value in the
%          mc2013.cls file to achieve the proper margins.

This paper describes closed form, Taylor series approximations to the number 
product stages in a multicomponent enrichment cascade.  Such closed form 
approximations are required when a symbolic, rather than a numeric, algorithm
is used to compute the optimal cascade state.  Both first and second order 
approximations were implemented.  The first order solution was found to be 
grossly incorrect, having the wrong functional form over the entire domain.
On the other hand, the second order solution shows excellent agreement with 
the `true' solution over the domain of interest. An implementation of the 
symbolic, second order solver is available in the free \& open source 
PyNE library.

\emph{Key Words}: PyNE, cyclus, Bright, fuel cycle
