\raggedright
The nuclear fuel cycle may be intrepreted as a network or graph, thus 
allowing methods from formal graph theory \cite{DIE05B} to be used with 
respect to it.  In this case the edges are seen as economic exchange 
between the nodes.  Often this exchange is modeled as a two way materials-for-money 
relationship.  However, what the nodes represent is considerably 
more complex.  

Nodes are often idealized as nuclear fuel cycle facilities (reactors, enrichment
cascades, deep geologic repositories).  Unlike the edges, though, distinct structure
is almost always needed to represent different kinds of facilities.  Intuitively, 
this is because facilties representing a fuel cycle implement unique, important 
tasks.  For instance, a power reactor is not subistutable for an enrichment facility
nor vice versa.  (Note that nodes may also sometimes 
represent regions or institutions which also exchange various commodities, 
instead of facilities.  The following discussion also applies to them as well).

With the advent of modern object-oriented programming languages and fuel cycle
simulators implemented in these languages, it is natural to define class heirarchies
of facility types.  This is because classes are the syntatic sugar for type 
declaration in a language.  Furthermore, having an extendable space of types is 
critical for developing new facility models.
